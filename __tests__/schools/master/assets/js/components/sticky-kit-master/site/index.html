Sticky-kit provides an easy way to attach elements to the page when the user
scrolls such that the element is always visible. The source can be found on

<h2>Basic Sticking</h2>

<div class="example">

$markdown{[[
Just call `stick_in_parent` on the elements you want to be stuck inside of
their parent. Sticky elements "bottom out" so they never leave the container,
no more worrying if a sticky element will accidentally cover your footer.
]]}

<div class="example_controls">
<button>Scroll it!</button>
$markdown{[[
```js
$("#sidebar").stick_in_parent();
```
]]}

  <div class="window_inner">
    <iframe src="$root/examples/1.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Many Sticky Items</h2>

<div class="example">

$markdown{[[
Have a lot of sticky columns, or different sticky portions of the page? Call
`stick_in_parent` on all the elements at once.
]]}

<div class="example_controls">
<button>Scroll it!</button>
$markdown{[[
```js
$(".sticky_column").stick_in_parent();
```
]]}
</div>

<div class="window_frame pink">
  <div class="window_title">Demo Browser</div>
  <div class="window_inner">
    <iframe src="$root/examples/2.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="example">
$markdown{[[
Not sure if your sidebar or your main content is taller? Doesn't matter, just
call `stick_in_parent` on all columns. Sticky-kit will only stick items if they
don't take up the entire height of their parent.
]]}

<div class="example_controls long_example">
<button>Scroll it!</button>
$markdown{[[
```js
$("#sidebar, #main_column").stick_in_parent();
```
]]}
</div>

<div class="window_frame pink">
  <div class="window_title">Demo Browser</div>
  <div class="window_inner">
    <iframe src="$root/examples/3.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Scrollable Sticky Element</h2>

<div class="example">
$markdown{[[
Sticky elements taller than the viewport can scroll independently up and down,
meaning you don't have to worry about your content being cut off should the
sticky element be too tall or the user's resolution too small.
]]}

<div class="example_controls">
<button>Scroll it!</button>

$("#sidebar").stick_in_parent();

To install include `jquery.sticky-kit.js` after including jQuery.

Usage:

```js
$("#sticky_item").stick_in_parent();
// or
$("#sticky_item").stick_in_parent(options);
```

You can pass a hash of options to configure how Sticky Kit works. The following
options are accepted, each one is optional:

* `parent` -- The element will be the parent of the sticky item. The
  dimensions of the parent control when the sticky element bottoms out. Defaults
  to the closest parent of the sticky element. Can be a selector.
* `inner_scrolling` -- Boolean to enable or disable the ability of the sticky
  element to scroll independently of the scrollbar when it's taller than the
  viewport. Defaults to `true` for enabled.
* `sticky_class` -- The name of the CSS class to apply to elements when they
  have become stuck. Defaults to `"is_stuck"`.
* `offset_top` -- offsets the initial sticking position by of number of pixels,
  can be either negative or positive
* `spacer` -- either a selector to use for the spacer element, or `false` to
  disable the spacer. The selector is passed to
  [`closest`](http://api.jquery.com/closest/), so you should nest the sticky
  element within the spacer. Defaults to Stiky Kit creating its own spacer.
* `bottoming` -- Boolean to control whether elements bottom out. Defaults to `true`
* `recalc_every` -- Integer specifying that a recalc should automatically
  take place between that many ticks. A tick takes place on every scroll event.
  Defaults to never calling recalc on a tick.

### Events

Various events are triggered from a sticky element when its state changes.
They are:

* `sticky_kit:stick` -- Triggered when element becomes stuck.
* `sticky_kit:unstick` -- Triggered when element becomes unstuck. (Note: an
  element is still considered stuck when it has bottomed out)
* `sticky_kit:bottom` -- Triggered when element bottoms out.
* `sticky_kit:unbottom` -- Triggered when element is no longer bottomed out.


For example, if we want to log when an element sticks and unsticks we might do:

```js
$("#sticky_item").stick_in_parent()
  .on("sticky_kit:stick", function(e) {
    console.log("has stuck!", e.target);
  })
  .on("sticky_kit:unstick", function(e) {
    console.log("has unstuck!", e.target);
  });
```

Sticky Kit listens to one event on `document.body`.

* `sticky_kit:recalc` -- trigger this event to cause all sticky elements to be
  recalculated. More information below.


Sticky Kit also listens to an event on the sticky elements:

* `sticky_kit:detach` -- remove sticky kit and restore element to original
  position

If you want to remove sticky kit from an element after applying it you can send
that element a `sticky_kit:detach` event.

For example:

```js
$("#sticky_item").trigger("sticky_kit:detach");
```

### Scrolling Performance

StickyKit takes scrolling performance very seriously. It's built from the
ground up to let you have sticky elements without incurring scroll lag or jank.

Probably the biggest cause of scrolling lag is `onscroll` handlers that do too much
work, trigger page reflows, etc. StickyKit avoids this by having a very light
scroll handler that operates on cached values.

If you notice that your sticky element is acting strange, like it pops to the
bottom of the page, or jumps around, then your cached value are most likely
outdated.  Luckily it's easy to fix, read *Recalculating Sticky Elements*
below.

Sticky Kit has two internal callbacks:

* `recalc` -- Updates the cached sizes of the elements it checks
* `tick` -- Checks and updates if necessary the sticky state from the cached values

A `tick` happens on every scroll event. It's designed to be as fast as possible.

A `recalc` happens whenever the cached values need to be updated. It's
(comparatively) slower, so you don't want to run this on every scroll event. A
`recalc` can happen automatically in the following cases: Sticky kit is first
initialized, on the following tick after the height of the document changes.

You can also manually trigger a `recalc` by sending an event, see below.

### Recalculating Sticky Elements

If you're changing the markup of your page on the fly by removing, adding or
resizing elements then you most likely need to tell Sticky Kit to recalculate
the sticky elements to guarantee they're positioned correctly.

You can manually cause a recalculation to happen by triggering an event on
`document.body`:

```js
$(document.body).trigger("sticky_kit:recalc");
```

Typically you only need to trigger a recalculation if you are changing the
positions/sizes of elements above the sticky element, adjacent to it, or the
sticky element itself.


Instead of manually calling `sticky_kit:recalc` you can use the `recalc_every`
option described above to periodically do a recalculation between ticks.
Setting it to 1 will cause a recalculation to happen on every scroll event,
preventing the state from ever being out of date.

```js
$("#sticky_item").stick_in_parent({recalc_every: 1});
```

### About Columns

If you're familiar with HTML and CSS then you probably know there are a handful
of different ways to make columns. Sticky kit works automatically with floated
columns, `inline-block` columns, or absolutely positioned elements. (Non column
elements like toolbars work great as well, for example the toolbar on this
site.)

### Browser Support

Sticky Kit works with all modern browsers, and IE7+.

Note: only floated columns work in IE7.
